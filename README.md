### Manual

<details>
    <summary>iOS (via CocoaPods)</summary>

    <summary>iOS (without CocoaPods)</summary>

In XCode, in the project navigator:

* Right click _Libraries_
* Add Files to _[your project's name]_
* Go to `node_modules/react-native-customui`
* Add the `.xcodeproj` file

In XCode, in the project navigator, select your project.

* Add the `libRNDeviceInfo.a` from the _deviceinfo_ project to your project's _Build Phases ➜ Link Binary With Libraries_
* Click `.xcodeproj` file you added before in the project navigator and go the _Build Settings_ tab. Make sure _All_ is toggled on (instead of _Basic_).
* Look for _Header Search Paths_ and make sure it contains both `$(SRCROOT)/../react-native/React` and `$(SRCROOT)/../../React`
* Mark both as recursive (should be OK by default).

Run your project (Cmd+R)

</details>

<details>
    <summary>Android </summary>

  - Add `import com.razorpay.rn.RazorpayPackage;` to the imports at the top of
  the file
  - Add `new RazorpayPackage()` to the list returned by the `getPackages()` method
2. Append the following lines to `android/settings.gradle`:
    ```gradle
    include ':react-native-razorpay'
    project(':react-native-razorpay').projectDir = new File(rootProject.projectDir,   '../node_modules/react-native-customui/android')
    ```

`android/app/build.gradle`:
    ```gradle
    implementation project(':react-native-customui')
    ```
</details>

## Usage

Sample code to integrate with Razorpay can be found in
[index.js][index.js] in the included example directory.

To run the example, simply do the following in example directory and then
link iOS SDK as explained in the previous section:

`$ npm i`

### Steps

1. Import Razorpay module to your component:
    ```js
    import Razorpay from 'react-native-customui';
    ```

2. Call `Razorpay.open` method with the payment `options`. The method
returns a **JS Promise** where `then` part corresponds to a successful payment
and the `catch` part corresponds to payment failure.
    ```js
    <TouchableHighlight onPress={() => {
      var options = {
        description: 'Credits towards consultation',
        currency: 'INR',
        key_id: 'rzp_test_1DP5mmOlF5G5ag',
        amount: '5000',
        email: 'void@razorpay.com',
        contact: '9999999123',
        method: 'netbaking',
        bank: 'HDFC'
        
      }
      Razorpay.open(options).then((data) => {
        // handle success
        alert(`Success: ${data.razorpay_payment_id}`);
      }).catch((error) => {
        // handle failure
        alert(`Error: ${error.code} | ${error.description}`);
      });
    }}>
    ```
